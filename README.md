# employee-management-system
The system allows employees to submit their details, which are stored in an AWS RDS MySQL database, and upload files (employee photos) to an S3 bucket.
The project also includes setting up Terraform for infrastructure as code, Jenkins for CI/CD, and DynamoDB for state file locking.
